           When people think of bees, the majority will think of a honeybee. A large colony of bees ruled by one queen, living in a hive, and producing honey.
          <p>A few might think of a bumble bee. A bumble bee as a singular species, not many.</p>
          <p>Many states have checklists but as of now, Virginia does not.</p>
          <p>The Discover Life website  is a very useful resource for bee identification, information, and pictures, BUT there is no easy way to get a list of all the bees that are keyed for your state.</p>
          <p>Being keyed for your state doesn't mean that bee is in your state, but that it has a good chance of being there. So it may have been there in the past (historical record) or it is found in a surrounding state and has the potential to be there.</p>
          <p>I went through the genera keyed for Virginia and pulled all possible species out!</p>
